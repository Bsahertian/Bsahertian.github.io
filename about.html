            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio! My name is Bryan Sahertian, and I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of hardware engineering, software development, and creative problem-solving. Born and raised in [Your Location], I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform lives.</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of technology started during my high school years at [Your High School Name], where I first dabbled in programming and electronics. This sparked a deep curiosity that led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering.</p>
            <p>After graduating from [Your High School Name] in 2022, I embarked on my academic journey at Kennesaw State University (KSU) as a Computer Engineering major. During my freshman year at KSU, I delved into courses like [Course Name 1] and [Course Name 2], gaining foundational knowledge in hardware design and programming languages like C and Java.</p>
            <p>Driven by a desire for academic excellence and a thirst for challenging projects, I made the pivotal decision to transfer to Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in the summer of 2023. At Georgia Tech, I've been immersed in a rigorous curriculum that has honed my skills in areas such as embedded systems, digital signal processing, and computer architecture.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I'm actively involved in [Clubs or Organizations] where I collaborate with peers on innovative projects and participate in hackathons to push the boundaries of what's possible in technology. My extracurricular activities include [Your Extracurricular Activities], which allow me to apply classroom knowledge to real-world challenges.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or tinkering with hardware, you can find me [Your Interests or Hobbies]. Whether it's playing soccer with friends, experimenting with new programming languages, or creating small glass terrariums, I thrive on the excitement of learning and exploring new avenues of creativity.</p>
            <p>This ePortfolio is a reflection of my journey, skills, and aspirations. Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to explore further to learn more about my projects, experiences, and interests.</p>
